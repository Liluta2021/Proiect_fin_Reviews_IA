It is suggested, in view of a magazine publication, compared the efficiency and effectiveness of activities without the support of these tools versus the current reality (with tools). Examples of possible questions to answer this exploratory analysis: What are the main activities where the use of collaborative tools is key? What changes in the design of these tools should be developed in the future? Are there profiles of students / academics more ahead for the adoption of these platforms?

       "       'The authors describe a methodology to develop, in collaborative form, theses and memories using technologies that are usually used in software development. They also describe concrete tools and their kindness as, for example, Latex and Git. Finally, they propose a workflow for the development of projects of this nature. The main value of the article lies in the application of knowledge that students already dominate - that is to say, techniques and tools of software development- to a different problem as is the case of the theses and memories. All this, with the desire to make the process more efficient. 1.- The emphasis of the article is the solution without making a detailed analysis of the problem that is intended to be resolved. In other words, there are no answers to the following questions: A.- What exactly is the problem? B.- What impacts does this problem generate? C.- Why is it important to solve the problem? D.- What solutions have been implemented to date? E.- What advantages does the proposed solution have compared to the previous ones? 2. In my opinion, the article should emphasize the methodology and the workflow more. For example, add a diagram - removing a visual language - that allows, on the one hand, to understand the general process of thesis development and, on the other, to distinguish the roles, activities and technologies associated in each memory phase. 3.- Some aspects of the language and the rigor of certain statements such as, for example: \"(given the rather atrocious spelling that engineers enjoy)\". Do the authors have an empirical support to support this affirmation? Is it necessary to resort to such a prosaic language to justify the convenience of using a certain technological tool? By the way, I recommend reviewing the expressions: \"It is not public\" (point 3.1) and \"having access directly ...\" (point 3.2)',\n",

I believe that this manuscript should be aimed at the area of Ã¢\\x80\\x8bÃ¢\\x80\\x8bcryptography and security, in my specialty that is computing in distributed environments I do not see significant relevance and contribution of the manuscript, using RMI according to my opinion is not a contribution per se, because RMI is easy To use if Java is handled, however, it is not interoperable since it does not support other programming languages, in addition, RMI-based system as they grow have a performance problem, the more slowly grow, on the other hand , according to some purists a client / server system is not a distributed system, according to others the client / server case is the most basic case of distributed computing, in short, strictly speaking from the distributed computing area I do not see relevance in this area of Ã¢\\x80\\x8bÃ¢\\x80\\x8bthis Manuscript, however, it seems to me that in another area the Paper could be relevant, since it is an orderly, clear and well-written work. I am not an expert in the area of Ã¢\\x80\\x8bÃ¢\\x80\\x8bcryptography, but a few years ago in an opportunity listen to an Englishman talking about quantum cryptography and I mention a lot of simulators and applications, even said having applications that already used quantum cryptography among several kilometers by means of fiber optic, then I think it is best to evaluate this manuscript in that area and not in the area of Ã¢\\x80\\x8bÃ¢\\x80\\x8bGrid / distributed systems, since in this area the Paper according to my opinion has no original aspects, as it uses trivial aspects of The client / server principles. As I have already said before, the Paper has more matters of quantum physics and cryptography than distributed computing, so abstracting me to the area that it competes, I see the use of a distributed environment technology used as a client / server, not interoperable and With scalability restrictions. A positive aspect in the Paper is that the use of software engineering is appreciated. As regards the Grid Computing area and distributed systems, the manuscript does not contain relevant aspects, uses RMI to implement a client / server system, eitherwhere, RMI is easy to use and as a good paradigm known in computing, Performance opposes Ease of use, RMI does not escape that, because it is easy to use, but it has no scalability. The document is well presented, perhaps Table 2 and Table 3 would be better to merge them using rows as a computer and in the columns the details of the network, especially if more than a client / server scheme is for example, a distribution ring of Quantum keys, with more than 2 computers involved. I think presented to the area of Ã¢\\x80\\x8bÃ¢\\x80\\x8bcryptography and security would be more pertinent.',\n",

The article proposes the use of a work philosophy of another engineering area, to improve the quality levels of the requirement documents generated in a process of education education.

The article proposes a requirements planning model, supported by an automatic tool. The prototype proposed is interesting and relevant. I think that the model and method proposed associated with it can be better organized, which is actually the real contribution of the authors.

Under this scheme, a low cost system is developed, with the advantages and limitations of the proposal. - I think the proposed system is part of an interesting premise that is its low cost. Commercial systems for this type of developments can be, on most occasions, very high costs, depending on the type of elements used. - Despite the simplicity of the proposed architecture, I think the system is improveable. For now, I think there is a way to travel (according to what is read in the paper) in terms of its use beyond the laboratory. That is why in originality (originity) is qualified with note 4 (good) - one of the first weaknesses found in the publication is its introduction. This sin, in my opinion, of two problems: the first problem is that its content is too general, in all its extension is spoken of what is the compute vision, in general, but interesting aspects such as the state of art are detailed In this matter and a relevant bibliography. It is only said to general features: \"In works carried out related to this topic, it is generally the object that moves in a millimetric form ...\". From this, doubts arise as: Are there other ways to rebuild surfaces? Are there similar jobs? How is this technique differentiated? What is the contribution of your work? Why not use Stereo view (perhaps costs are similar)?. The second problem found is a consequence of the first, since when trying to explain what is a computer vision to being too long (a little more than three columns), and too general. Perhaps if the attention was focused on the state of art this would not see it as a problem. - In the technical aspect I see that your approach can work in a very controlled environment, where there are great lighting changes and the surface of the scanned objects are not very similar to the bottom and / or laser beam used. The background subtraction for controlled environments can work but outdoors I doubt that your system is so stable. I think that the different methods used for segmentation could have been listed in the text. On page 4 reference is made but not deepened (\"for segmentation different methods were tested, of which the value method was selected ...\"). Perhaps it would be good to take advantage of some color space (RBG, YUV, etc.) and use the distance from Mahalanobis (obtain a sample of a laser beam or several) to obtain a better segmentation of laser light. - About the presentation, I have found some errors that would be good to improve: - Figure 2 and Figure 3 have the same title, I think there is an error with the title of Figure 3. - Figure 2 has some errors and which can induce to error. \"Light projector\", the \"of\" is underlined.

For this disarticulation, it is possible that the consequence between what they present in the summary and what is found in the development of the Paper is not very clear. - I consider that the title should not focus only on 'tools', because when you start reading the idea that the contribution and review is more at the operational and systems that support the process, but not initiatives in terms of Standards, projects and technologies developed for this purpose.

       "       'This Paper presents important problems in its formulation. The papers of practical experiences must deliver something more than a simple description of the developed system: they must clearly indicate what new knowledge, technique or solution was obtained from said experience. Consequently, a paper of this nature should include, at least, the following essential elements: - an introduction clearly explains the purpose of work: (a) The problem that was resolved directly or indirectly with practical experience, (b) why The problem is important and not trivial and (c) why this experience delivered new information within said context (not obtained with similar experiences). - Theoretical framework - The description of the system: It should not be a mere enumeration of its components and functionalities, but clearly indicate those elements that, during their development, contributed relevant information to the problem of the study. - Conclusions: They must be aligned with the elements of the introduction and must be supported by the evidence delivered in the description of the system. Analyzing the Paper under this perspective, we find important problems: first, the introduction is not clear about the purpose of work and. The only part where the objectives are mentioned is in the 5th searcher, where it is indicated that the case study is \"to empirically demonstrate the development costs\" associated with the technologies shown in the Paper. This, along with \"highlighting the main characteristics and potential virtues of CakePhp and MVC ..\" They seem to be the central elements of the paper. Second, the description of the system does not differ greatly from a system manual; There is a lack of essential evidence to support the elements of the introduction: associated development costs (time, persons, resources) that are supposed, should be less than with another methodology. While the sections described by CakePHP and MVC have relevant information for the problem, do not provide value to work if they are not supported by evidence obtained directly from the development experience with this technology. Above all, I missed a comparison with some other similar experience, indicating, clearly what development improvements introduces CakePHP / MVC. Finally, the Paper\\'s conclusions are not aligned with the elements indicated in the introduction; Some of them provide information outside the context (conclusions # 5 and # 6) or are irrelevant (Conclusion # 2); Others lack evidence that support them (conclusion # 1) or are not explicit in associating evidence with the end (conclusions # 3 and # 4). Apart from previous observations, the Paper also requires improvements in the presentation of information. For example, it is not explicit the value that the SQL code of Figures 10 and 11 delivers the Paper. Figures 12-15 are not properly described. A person who does not understand well the work with command line can end totally disoriented and will not understand the arguments made.

SQL code is presented without specifying as it is related to the CakePHP Framework. The contribution of the screenshots presented is not clearly identified.

General comments:  a) Concerning the proposed approach: The segmentation method introduced only considers local color/gray value information. Perhaps introducing other features related to the membrane\\'s local (e.g. the membrane has symmetry properties that can be exploited) or global (e.g. continuity, approximately circular shape) properties may improve the segmentation results.  Feature selection is also a key component to improve performance. Use a feature selection procedure.  b) Concerning the experimentation: You should describe the experiments with sufficient detail so others can replicate them: a) Make your data publicly available b) Explain how you have selected the classifier\\'s parameters (parameter selection in an SVM is critical and may improve notably the performance).  You should join Figs 10 and 9 in a single plot so we can better see the differences.  You only provide qualitative segmentation results (Figs. 12, 14, 15), but quantitative results are also very important. Specially when it comes to comparisons. You should quantitatively compare your algorithm with other competing works in the literature.  c) Concerning paper organization: The paper is well written and clearly introduces the problem, describes the relevant literature and presents the solution. I have a few comments concerning the paper organization: a) Problem statement and literature review (intro and theoretical framework sections) are in my opinion a bit long, compared to other important sections, e.g. feature extraction and experimentation which are just one paragraph each. b) Although English is in general correct, there are some small mistakes that could be solved by having it read by a professional. c) There are two \"proposed method\" sections  Well written paper.

Color-based features are used, the frequency and global response for each of the local tables in which an entry image is divided. In this way, information is introduced from different types to the CBIR system to represent the images. - The article does not clearly delimit your contributions. It seems that something is given regarding the characteristic space in which the images are represented and it also seems that it brings something in the algorithms and data structures necessary to accelerate searches in metric spaces. - In general, the article uses little space to explain the proposed approach to CBIR (two references to the thesis are given).

Are there related jobs? Are there important references? What is the contribution of work on the state of art?, Etc. A more exhaustive bibliographic review is missing. - In the \"Extraction of features\" section I have found some details such as: - it has cost me to find a definition on the technique of layout since there is only one reference [1], so I intuyo that the characteristics obtained from Each sub-image as a signal which are mixed to obtain the vector that represents the total image, as it says in the text: \"The union of all the extracted characteristics gives us as a result ...\", where it is not clear The \"Union\" type that is made. - The same thing also happens when Fisher\\'s discrimination is referenced, reference is referenced again [1]. A more relevant source should be added for this point. - The type of database used is not explained in detail. Is it public or private domain? What kind of images or groups of images contains. How many are there for class?, Are there repeated images? Quality of the images. The idea is to have a frame of reference so that any person who wants to compare their algorithms with their own makes them on equal terms. - From the images shown in Figure 2, I can deduce which database (I hope to be wrong) has repeated images which can produce a bias when calculating the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values Ã¢\\x80\\x8bÃ¢\\x80\\x8bof recovered images. I believe that the ideal database to correctly measure the quality of the recovery should have different images even if they are of the same appearance, but never it. Since when recovering a set of images about a query, if they are repeated, the number of true positives will be proportional to repeated what will result in a bias on the calculation of metrics.

I think that currently there are projects such as http: // similar- images.googlelabs.com/, http://www.like.com/, http://www.tineye.com/, among others; They show a great progress in this field and it would be good to be reviewed. - On the other hand, on the set of features used I recommend reviewing other types of features that have proven to be invariant to scale and rotation.

This translates that there is no clear proposal by the authors and who try to propose is only seen on the last page. 2) Another weakness is that it does not establish any way to evaluate and compare the different applications of the subject in order to connect them with the theory and submit an article contribution. For this reason, it does not comply with what is established in its Abstract: \"..

Basically, the model considers three properties to evaluate its quality: social skill, autonomy and pro-activity. To evaluate these properties, the author breaks down these properties into several measurable sub-properties. The author evaluates this model through a study case: a banking system.

That said, this work lacks some points that (for me) is important to address: * The author mentions that there is no model to evaluate the quality of agent software, and he proposes one. The proposal of Him is an ADAPTATION OF ISO / IEC, however, the author does not justify why it is appropriate. * With respect to the previous point, paragraph 1 of the introduction says there is no model that measures the quality of the software. Then, paragraph 2 mentions that there are some jobs about this. The author should clarify the contribution of him. * The author mentions that software was developed for this work, however, this work appears as another more publication (and from another author). If it is the aforementioned software is not part of the contributions of the work, please eliminate these phrases. Other comments: * In the study case section it is not so easy to understand it. For example, Figures 2, 5 and 7 is not understood to refer to its acronyms (eg AMS). I suppose they correspond to the sub-properties. * It is recommended to exchange section 3 by section 2. That is, first explain that it is an agent and then talk about related work. * It is not clear if it is \"Software Agent\" or \"Software Agent\".

Develop interpreters using the Antlr tool on Android is the main connection of these activities. The first activity implements a parader / interpreting for a calculator. The second activity incorporates the ability to order lists in the interpreter. The last activity incorporates the voice recognition service using a Google bookstore. According to work, the result of these activities allowed students to better understand the concepts of formal languages. General assessment: The work describes very clearly how activities were carried out in the elective course. However, from my point of view, the work presents two great weaknesses: 1) The main motivation of work is that the use of the antlr tools are useful for the courses of formal languages. However, there is never a sample of why this statement is true, they are only detailed as implementing the activities of the activities. It is strongly advisable to give real signs (eg justifications, experiments, etc.) of why these tools help the teaching of these topics. 2) This point is the cause of the previous point. Not a motivation or problem that clearly shows the need to use these tools for a language course. If the authors manage to find a clear and measurable motivation, point 1) can be resolved.

The results are analyzed statistically using variance analysis. The article is well written and the experiment is presented clearly. The bibliographical references seem appropriate. In the introduction, the comparison objectives are correctly justified and the possible approaches for the navigation of a robot are described in a general way. The selection of metrics is justified and tries to go beyond a combination of simple measurements. The experiment is well described, although it could be explained why other obstacle configurations were not included in the observation. The statistical methods (analysis of variance) are applied correctly, although an analysis of normality could be included in the distribution. One of the weak points of work is that a deeper discussion of the results is needed. Beyond indicating that one of the architectures has better performance, the reasons should be discussed and carry out new conjectures. The generalization of the results and the discussion of threats to validity must be part of the discussion. For example: What kind of obstacles do each algorithm improve? What is the programming effort of each of the architectures? What are the high-level navigation objectives of the robot (deliberative behavior)?',\n",

It seems relevant to study as impact these competences in professional success, or, at least, in the subjective preception of this success. The study contains references to relevant sources, although it is suggested to reduce the number and prioritize for the case of articles in journals or congresses. While the topic is relevant there are some risks in the definition of constructs that are not analyzed. What are the limits between the perception of professional and personal success? Can a study of the perception of professional success only considering the BTM model and leaving the technological competences? Does the study apply to all IT professionals or only those who manage technological projects like CIOS? The main weakness of research is that it is identified as an experimental method, when in fact the survey does not have the degree of control over the study object to qualify this way. There is also talk of causality study, but the survey would only allow a co-relationship study. On the survey, what are the factors evaluated and the lickert scale is explained. However, examples of concrete questions are missing and explaining how they are going to be answered by the subjects.

In addition, another criticism that would do is that although the ideas of CMMI and agile development seem well described, it does not happen the same about adequately justifying its specific application in SMEs. I think the item could be improved substantially. A suggestion that would make for this would be the presentation of a case that gives strength to the central argument of the article, that is, CMMI and agile development are compatible and especially useful for SMEs.

The authors qualitatively evaluate the performance of the interface in terms of the ease of interpreting the information it delivers. To do this, expose the information to a group of users. The evaluation method by users is one known and validated. However, the article explains very superficially the user validation process used. On the other hand, the results of the evaluation presented are only descriptive.

In the words of the authors \"The objective of this work is to review the state of art in terms of the treatment of points clouds\". In my opinion, he does not achieve this goal declared by them. My reasons are expressed below. First, it draws attention as an article that pretending to establish the state of art, has a very scarce bibliography (14 articles). In that sense, it would be more appropriate to indicate that this work is of a preliminary type (if it is that way) since that way would be justified such a low number of revised items. Second, and that seems to me of greater relevance, the work does not make an adequate summary of the bibliography, but rather it seems to be a note on some methods of filtering and segmentation. A review of the state of art, in my opinion, should have a purpose as to identify the main literature gaps or research opportunities. Third, although a bibliographic review is, in essence, a summary, it must be systematic. That is, you must have a method that has to be specified. For example, what was the search equation used and what was the time range and selection criteria of the revised items or which were eliminated and why. Finally, although it does not have to do with the content or objective of the article, there are evident problems of format. For example, the entire section of conclusions is centered instead of justified. In addition, there are drafting problems that in some parts makes the understanding difficult difficult. For example, the first paragraph in the subsection \"segmentation\" says \"the process of generating a surface model from a cloud of points, the segmentation that extracts the edges and partitions of the 3D world, the points play an important role in the lace of The surfaces.\" There are also spelling errors such as writing \"Laser\" and \"Laser\" in different parts of the document.

       "       'Summary: The work is presented and described the application of a social network for news (4x4News), where the most relevant news will be present (among other features). This application is characterized by a screen divided into a 16x16 matrix, where each cell is a news. GENERAL EVALUATION: The work is well written and follows a format (almost) completely suitable for infonor. The application sounds interesting and potentially useful as an add-on for commonly used social networks (eg Facebook). There are several independent points that I consider that they are important to resolve: 1) While it is an interesting engineering job, I can not see what is the contribution / contribution from the scientific point What can be re-used for this work for a future work scientific? 2) Since you offer an application, I think it is fundamental a link to (com) try this application. 3) In my opinion, the website http://terra.cl approaches the proposed by this work. It was so, because Terra allows User Registration (profiles), comment on news, value news, and configure the website to show the news that a user wants. 4) This could be a minor detail, I think that the use of social networks could be used for more than just showing the most important news (eg, show a kind of tracking (social) of a similar news (s) ). Minor details: - At the end of the introduction, the use of BOLD is not recommended. - \"Heholders do not perform a good analysis.\" What is a \"good\" analysis? During the work, several adjectives used ambiguous and that are unnecessary (eg \"complex process\" in section 2.1). - Within section 2: \"Development\", there is related work (Section 2.1). This section should be re-structured. - Quotes of type \"X, and others, year\" (eg section 2.2 \"Wilson, and others, 2014\"), I think they are incorrect. They should use \"et al\". - Section 2.2, is the word coincidence enough to say that two news are similar? I think that a deeper annAL is a necessary. - Explain the \"Bundles\" concept a little more. - Numbers are used in the references [1], but in the text it does not use numbers. I recommend following the infonor format.',\n",

The theme of work is fundamentally oriented to present and comment on Infocom application and how it eventually works in the company. However, in terms of its theoretical, methodological discussion and the analysis of the results, this article presents multiple failures that are detailed below: The introduction of the article in general highlights the relevance of the application built for the company in particular but does not detail the innovative From this proposal and because this information system is better in terms of development or which are the characteristics that distinguish it from what currently exists in the market. Nor is the author clearly established the motivation that has led him to develop a new solution for the problem proposed. A research objective is defined as such of the article since it is mentioned that this will be that of \"exposing a commercial information system adaptable to any retail business ...... ..\". In general, it is desired to present the constructed application and is not specified that the article is expected, the methodologies to be used and the innovative in terms of development for the discipline of the information systems. One of the main limitations of this article is the state of art. The review of the literature is almost non-existent in relation to the theories that support the development of the application and the main authors in topics of platform development of this nature are mentioned. Article is not established any theoretical framework in terms of design or implementation of the application. Nor are proposals discussed in those terms so it is possible to say that there are no theoretical references in terms of analysis, design and implementation. This difficulty causes the evaluation of what has been developed to be only based on opinions in general of what is the concept of information systems. The methodology of research is another important fence of this article. The article moves between the importance of the application to a description of what it is possible to do with it without establishing clear and accepted methodologies of development and implementation (or for the design of the tool or for the analysis of the results obtained from its use ). This complicates the evaluation of work since there are no research questions to respond, or ways to evaluate if the expectations of the author or if the results obtained will be valid. The author of the article should present and describe the research designs to be used to allow assessing its validity. Most of the article is in the development item and it defines and details the characteristics of the company in which the study will be developed. It is not clearly specified which parts of the systems are commercially acquired and which are developed internally and how the connection with other existing platforms is achieved. Nor are processed or data models associated with this construction. The authors are limited to explaining the functionalities of the tool and how it will be used in the company but it is not possible to know how the results that stand out as relevant from the implementation was implemented and compared. Although the tool can be very simple from one point of view of its design and architecture, a description would be expected that presenting processed models using ad-hoc tools and at least a description of the design stage The results obtained in general are mentioned as Something that was achieved and as percentages of improvements in management and it is not possible to extract valid conclusions about them. The conclusion of the article is weak in terms of the results obtained from the design and implementation of the application and above all of the contribution of the study to the discipline of information systems. I believe that the article requires greater changes and that must work on the definition of the objective, the methodology to be used for the analysis and design of the platform. Therefore I suggest your rejection for this conference on this occasion',\n",

The proposed model is oriented to decoupling the business logic of business rules. The problem that addresses the article is adequately supported in the difficulties mentioned in the field of software projects and in the financial world. The author could deepen a little more in project development experiences in other areas and relevance of business rules in the development of efficient information systems in the company. The objective declared by the author is to propose a methodology that allows the operation of the information systems to be flexible in the financial institutions, which is generally explained in an appropriate manner. The bibliographic review is pertinent to the topics that are addressed and the theories and models considered are adequate to the objective it has been proposed. The analyzes associated with the concept of business rules and system architecture are atingentes to the subject. The author should specify as established the relationship between process modeling and design and characterization of business rules. He is mentioned that they use the tables of decision points, but these are not mentioned in detail or visually. The author should better sustain the choice of \"Pipes and Filter\" as a system architecture model. It would be important to note also if there are similar works carried out in other areas (since the author does not mention it) the methodological aspect of work focuses on describing the process through which it is reached to the definition of software architecture to automate rules of business and the tools that were used in their development. This methodological approach is adequate and clearly associated with a case study application. The important contribution in this aspect is the detailed description of the process from the rise of the rules to the design and development of the proposed application architecture. The author should make a summary table in which this process is shown in summary form. It is clear that the results of this work have the desired validity, as it is based on the use of models and tools already validated in the field of business platforms based on rules. The contribution of work is important since it systematizes a process that is widely used in the development of information systems that are flexible and adaptable to the changing environment. However, in the conclusions, these contributions are not clearly reflected by the authors to improve the conclusions including significant contributions in methodological terms and of contribution to the discipline in which the article is framed. The formal aspects of work are satisfactory for Congress. There are minor details in grammar as in the first paragraph of the introduction of the letter U.

       "       'The article is entitled \"Software architecture for the automation of business rules at the receipt of credit requests in financial institutions.\" In the summary it is indicated that the work aims to propose an automation model of business rules that achieves decoupling the business logic, however during the document is not referred to any model. A methodology is presented in the section with its name, but it is not clear how this methodology allows to generate a business rules automation model. The article lacks a logical sequence of sections that account for the explicit proposal cited in the summary. In the section Architecture of the System, the architecture of a system is presented and aspects of architecture are explained. However, in said section it is not possible to identify an automation model of business rules. Taking into account that the article lacks a strong work to improve the presentation of it that allows to understand the proposal that is carried out, I suggest rejecting it. Next, some observations can be seen to improve the work: Although the methodology used is explained in detail by phases, in none of them is referenced to the results achieved in their implementation in the case of work that is exposed, that is, Applied in an environment of financial entities. In the System Architecture section, Figure 5 is presented and Figure 6 but they are not explained or contextualized within the document. This generates confusion. In this section, the application of the methodology exposed in the previous section is identified, in relation to the generated architecture. It should clearly indicate how architecture was achieved from the selected methodology and explained in the methodology section. In the introduction that is clear what is the proposal of the work presented. A paragraph should be structured where a definition of the objective is included and the solution proposal that is made taking into account the title of the work.

The figures should be cited in the text, with the corresponding number in the title of the figure. - Figure 3 is not understood. The text is very small and it is not possible to identify the business process model referred to in the immediately previous paragraph. - The last paragraph on page 6 is not understood and spoken in the first person. The wording should be corrected. - In the section Methodology, reference is made to a project that has not been described above. It would be advisable to explain what the project referred to be referred to. In this section it is not clear the type of methodology to which reference is made. It can be a research methodology or an architecture development methodology.',\n",
       "       \"Throughout the article, the role of automation of testing within software tests is exaggerated and more generally in the securing framework. A maturity model for software test necessarily includes more aspects than automation. Automated cases will always coexist with manual cases and evaluations performed by people. As it is treated in the article, automation is too general a concept, it can cover the generation, execution, evaluation (for example: mutation, coverage criteria) and validation (oracle problem). Although the motivation is clearly expressed in the introduction, references are needed to support the affirmations made on the role of the test and the impact of automation in it. To say that automation allows you to perform the tests faster or at lower cost is simplistic: this depends on the context. The costs of generating automatic test cases, the estimate on the future evaluation of the software and the expiration of the cases of evidence, together with other factors, must be taken into account in the cost model to determine the convenience of automating a certain part of the proof. The section dedicated to the software test makes general definitions and travels the history of the test from the mainframes. For a research article, I suggest making more specific definitions related to the focus of the study (experimental studies on test techniques, automation, test costs, maturity models). It would be adequate to put the development of the maturity model after presenting related work. The process is not described to obtain the proposal of a maturity model for testing. The development of the model must be linked to other existing maturity models (for example the Testing Maturity Model) establish connections with the accepted literature of testing or standards (for example ISO 29119) and in general with software process models. The search string used is not explicit. Not all models found must be catalyst as 'maturity models'. Some of the models included are clearly more general models, which do not focus on the problem of the automation of the tests. It should at least discuss these differences. The attributes used in Table III are not explained, nor how to obtain maturity level results. What does 'level of published opinions' mean? This concept is ambiguous. The description of this research process must be reinforced since it is key to obtaining the 'adolescent' level result.\",\n",

The motivation of why they were selected are not described.

In the second section, several models are presented, but the relationships between them are not clear and what is the criterion to take them into account in this line of research. There are multiple proposals for software quality models and specific models for Web. On the other hand, the OWASP guides are relevant to the security of web applications, they are not a quality model. I suggest exposing the theoretical analysis (which includes basic quality definitions) before the description and justification of the models considered. On the other hand, specific concepts / attributes / quality models could be added in the context of banking systems. In my opinion, dedicating so much space to define the concept of electronic banking, Internet banking and then that of mobile banking, it is not necessary in the state of current art and public knowledge of these concepts. I suggest focusing on research objectives of this particular work. The descriptions of the Demet Methodological Framework and the Research Methodology - Action are very brief.
